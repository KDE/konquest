GnuLactic Conquest</H1>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>This the KDE version of Gnu-Lactic Konquest, a multi-player strategy
game. The goal of the game is to expand your interstellar empire across
the galaxy and of course, crush your rivals in the process.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4>
Playing The Game</H4>
When the game starts, you and all of your opponents each have control of
one planet, with the remainder of the planets under control of their native,
agrarian, non-aggressive inhabitants.

<P>To begin your conquest of the galaxy, you will need to send out raiding
parties to your neighboring planets. Each player in turn will be prompted
to enter a set of fleet movements for the current turn. To enter a fleet
movement, select the source planet by keyboard (the planets are "named"
after single letters/numbers/glyphs) or by mouse (click once on the planet).
Then, enter the number of ships to send.

<P>Each grid on the map represents 0.5 light years, and the ships travel
at "light speed". So, a fleet traveling to an adjacent sector will arrive
at the end of the current turn. A fleet traveling to a sector 2 grids away
will arrive in the next turn.

<P>After entering all of your moves, click the "End Turn" button.

<P>When a fleet arrives at a planet that you already own, the arriving
fleet will be absorbed into the defense fleet stationed at the planet.

<P>When a fleet arrives at a planet you don't own, a fight for control
of the planet will begin. It is a fight to the death, and either the attacking
fleet will be destroyed and the planet will hold. Or, the home defense
fleet will be destroyed and the attacker will assume control of the planet

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<CENTER>Hint</CENTER>
Defense fleets have an advantage over attackers. It's safe to assume that
you will need several more ships to take a planet than currently hold it.
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>The Planet Status indicator (the big black box on the left) is your
source for intelligence on the state of the Galaxy. Your spies will report
on the status of your rivals, but not on the native-controlled planets.
The information present in the display is: name, owner, production rate,
fleet strength and kill percentage. The production rate is the number of
ships that planet will construct in one turn. The fleet strength is the
number of ships currently in place at the planet. And, the kill percentage
is a measure of the effectiveness of the ships produced at that planet.
Attack fleets take the kill percentage of their planet of departure, and
defense fleets use the kill percentage of the planet they are defending.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<CENTER>Hint</CENTER>
If you capture a planet with a high kill percentage, you may want to funnel
some of your attack fleets through this planet, as they will "pick up"
the kill percentage of this planet.

Notes</H4>
You may experience problems on low-color (8bpp) displays. Konquest is color-eater,
entirely because of the scanned graphics.
