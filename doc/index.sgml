<abstract>This the KDE version of Gnu-Lactic Konquest, a multi-player strategy
game. The goal of the game is to expand your interstellar empire across the
galaxy and of course, crush your rivals in the process.

<sect>Playing The Game
<p>
When the game starts, you and all of your opponents each have control of one
planet, with the remainder of the planets under control of their native,
agrarian, non-aggressive inhabitants.

To begin your conquest of the galaxy, you will need to send out raiding parties
to your neighboring planets. Each player in turn will be prompted to enter a set
of fleet movements for the current turn. To enter a fleet movement, select the
source planet by keyboard (the planets are &quot;named&quot; after single
letters/numbers/glyphs) or by mouse (click once on the planet). Then, enter the
number of ships to send. 

Each grid on the map represents 0.5 light years, and the ships travel at
&quot;light speed&quot;. So, a fleet traveling to an adjacent sector will
arrive at the end of the current turn. A fleet traveling to a sector 2 grids
away will arrive in the next turn. 

After entering all of your moves, click the &quot;End Turn&quot; button.

When a fleet arrives at a planet that you already own, the arriving fleet will be absorbed into the defense fleet stationed at the planet. 

When a fleet arrives at a planet you don't own, a fight for control of the planet will begin. It is a fight to the death, and either the attacking fleet will be destroyed and the planet will hold. Or, the home
defense fleet will be destroyed and the attacker will assume control of the planet 

<bf/Hint/ Defense fleets have an advantage over attackers. It's safe to assume
that you will need several more ships to take a planet than currently hold it.

<sect1>Planet Status
<p>
The Planet Status indicator (the big black box on the left) is your source for
intelligence on the state of the Galaxy. Your spies will report on the status of
your rivals, but not on the native-controlled planets. The information present
in the display is: name, owner, production rate, fleet strength and kill
percentage. The production rate is the number of ships that planet will
construct in one turn. The fleet strength is the number of ships currently in
place at the planet. And, the kill percentage is a measure of the effectiveness
of the ships produced at that planet. Attack fleets take the kill percentage 
of their planet of departure, and defense fleets use the kill percentage of the
planet they are defending.

<bf/Hint/ If you capture a planet with a high kill percentage, you may want to
funnel some of your attack fleets through this planet, as they will &quot;pick
up&quot; the kill percentage of this planet.

<sect>Notes
<p>
You may experience problems on low-color (8bpp) displays. Konquest is color-eater, entirely because of the scanned graphics.
