Short term stuff
================


Game play and usability
-----------------------

* Create a small widget for summary of orders. Should be of the size
  of the previous planetinfo widget and at the same place to the
  right.

* Let the user create orders by dragging the mouse from one planet	Pinaraf
  to another



Structure and other code issues
-------------------------------

* Cleanup the old code							ingwa
   - gameview
   - mapview								done
   - minimapview							done
   - fleetdlg
   - newgamedlg
   - scoredlg

* Remove gamecore.h

* Complete the separation between the model and the view of the game.	DONE
  This is done by separating GameBoard --> GameLogic, GameView.

* Use QGraphicsScene/QGraphicsView instead of MapView

* Refactor the GameView
   - Remove AI players from it
   - More signals/slots from gamelogic



Long term stuff
===============

* Multiplayer via the internet
