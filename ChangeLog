	because of the upcoming release of KDE 3.4.

2004-08-22  Inge Wallin  <inge@lysator.liu.se>

	* gameboard.cc (nextTurn): Fixed a grammatical error.

0.99.4 --
	Brought the KDE CVS tree in sync with my own. Changes from previous version
        include:
		-- removed dependence on libg++ random integer classes
                -- fixed a couple of problems with the game state machine.

0.0.4 --
	Fixed (hopefully) a compiler error. gamecore.cc would compile fine with
		debug (-g), but not with the optimizer (-O2). Added a destructor
		and things seem okay.

	Added the distance measuring function of the original game. It appears as a
		in the toolbar.

0.0.3 -- 
	wasn't keeping a changelog prior to 0.0.4
